[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/MasterJayanX/pmfow-updater.svg)](https://github.com/MasterJayanX/pmfow-updater/releases)

## Description
This tool allows you to update pmfow to the latest version available. You can run it by running `pmfow-updater` in a CMD window. It will be included with pmfow starting from version 0.1.5, but for now, you can install it from here.

## Requirements
- pmfow-updater must be installed on the same directory as pmfow.
- Windows XP or above is required to run it (haven't tested it on Windows 2000).
